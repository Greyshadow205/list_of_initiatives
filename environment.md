>Tap water in London is among the best in the world in terms of quality. Unfortunately, it doesn’t always taste great and therefore Londoners have been fooled in recent years to believe that it’s unhealthy. The only known risks are lead from local pipes and microplastics. For anyone concerned about taste or these risks an affordable water filter such as TAPP can be a good option.
